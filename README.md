# NN_ODE
Neural networks usage for solving first and second order differential equasion - miniproject.

## Neural networks description
To solve first order differential equasion we have created model with below number of layers: <br/>
input 1--32--32--1 output <br/>
The model was being trained 1000 steps.

To solve second order differential equasion we have created model with below number of layers: <br/>
input 1--256--256--256--1 output <br/>
The model was being trained 200 steps.

## Library used:
